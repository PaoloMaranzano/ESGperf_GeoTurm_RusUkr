This is an excel file that contains a mixture of real and masked data, as a support to the submission of the paper:
ESG Performance and Stock Market Responses to Geopolitical Turmoil: evidence from the Russia-Ukraine War

This file contains data to replicate the empirical approach to arrive to the estimation of equation (2), in the worksheet "Foglio1"
We recall that data used in the paper are partly subject to non-disclosure agreement and cannot be made public.
Columns in yellow are specifically changed with respect to the original database. Specifically
* Column A contains a random ID number 
* Column I contains a random Industry Adjusted ESG score

The data in the worksheet "Foglio1" needs to be upladed into the Stata software.
For this purpose, we also attach the correspendent do file to upload and replicate the empirical exercise.

Please, notice that due to the masking process, the actual results presented in the paper cannot be exactly replicated.
